# MusicGenreDB

Welcome to **MusicGenreDB**, an archive dedicated to preserving and extending the original work of Glenn McDonald, the former Data Alchemist at Spotify, known for his project [Every Noise at Once](https://www.everynoise.com/). This repository aims to maintain and potentially expand on the intricate genre classifications that McDonald created, ensuring the longevity and accessibility of this valuable data.

## Project Overview

**MusicGenreDB** is an extensive collection of 6,291 genre-shaped distinctions as categorized by Spotify. Each song in this repository is associated with a unique ID that links it to detailed metadata. This project serves as an archive and aims to possibly introduce new features in the future to enhance the original concept.

## Data Structure

The repository contains two main components:

1. **songs/**: A folder with 6,291 audio files. Each file is named with a number corresponding to its ID.
2. **songs_data.json**: A JSON file containing metadata for each song. The structure of the JSON file is as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "SONG ID",
        "genre": "SONG GENRE",
        "url": "SONG URL",
        "title": "ARTIST - SONG NAME",
        "color": "CHOSEN COLOR"
    }
]
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MusicGenreDB.git
    cd MusicGenreDB
    ```

2. **Explore the data**: You can browse the `songs/` folder to access the audio files directly or use the `songs_data.json` file to retrieve detailed information about each song.
